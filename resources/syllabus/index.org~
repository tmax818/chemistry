*  Course Overview

This course explores the principles of chemistry through hands-on activities, labs, and discussions. The second semester focuses on applying foundational knowledge to chemical reactions, energy transformations, and advanced concepts like equilibrium and kinetics. The syllabus is aligned with [[https://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/pl/documents/ngsshsphyicalscidci.pdf][California State Standards]] and [[https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/18290/next-generation-science-standards-for-states-by-states][NGSS]].
