#+title: week one: knowing your learners

The Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) are the de dicto guidlines for science instruction in California.  Los Angeles Unified School District(LAUSD), the district I anticipate working as a science educator, has adopted the thee-course model for high school science education(citation). This means that sudents take Biology, Chemistry and Physics in that order. I have decided to plan a week long lesson in atomic theory. This has tradtionally been an early unit covered in high school chemistry. 


* Prior academic knowledge related to the specific content you plan to teach

- assessment: Students will take a pre-assessment [[quiz][quiz]] to determine knowledge of subject matter to be covered in the atomic theory lesson.
- data collection: Student performance on the pre-assessment will inform instruction for the comming week. My plan is to develop a real-time data collection system using web technology.
 

* Cultural and linguistic resources and funds of knowledge (i.e., knowledge and skill derived from the cultural experience)

- assessment: Students will form small groups and discuss how important food preparation is in their family.  

* Prior experience and interests related to the content you plan to teach


* Life experience(s) either inside or outside of school that may result in a need for additional academic and/or emotional support

* Social identity (studentsâ€™ expressed self-concept derived from a social group that is evident through peer and/or adult interactions inside or outside of school)

* Developmental considerations
