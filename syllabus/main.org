* Course Description
Chemistry AB is a laboratory-based college-preparatory course. Laboratory experiments provide the empirical basis for understanding and confirming concepts. This course emphasizes discussions, activities, and laboratory exercises, which promote the understanding of the behavior of matter at the macroscopic and the molecular-atomic levels. Chemical principles are introduced so that students will be able to explain the composition and chemical behavior of their world. Chemistry AB lays the foundation for further studies in Chemistry and also serves as an Advanced Placement Chemistry readiness course. 

*Chemistry AB meets the Grades 9-12 District physical science requirement. Students must complete one physical and one life science requirement. This course meets one year of the University of California 'd' entrance requirement for laboratory science.*

* Course Objectives

** The Periodic Table
- Students know how to use the periodic table to identify:
  - metals, semimetals, nonmetals, halogens, alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, and transition metals, lanthanide, actinide, and transactinide elements[fn:transactinite:know that the transuranium elements were synthesized and identified in laboratory experiments through the use of nuclear accelerators.]
  - trends in ionization energy, electronegativity, and the relative sizes of ions and atoms.
** Atomic Structure
- Students know the experimental basis for:
  - Thomson's discovery of the electron
  - Rutherford's nuclear atom,
  - Millikan's oil drop experiment, and
  - Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect.
  - the development of the quantum theory of atomic structure
  - the historical importance of the Bohr model of the atom.
- Students know that spectral lines are the result of transitions of electrons between energy levels and that these lines correspond to photons with a frequency related to the energy spacing between levels by using Planck's relationship ($E = hv$).

** Chemical Bonding
- Students know how to draw Lewis dot structures.
- Students know atoms combine to form molecules by sharing electrons to form covalent or metallic bonds or by exchanging electrons to form ionic bonds.
