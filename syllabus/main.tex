\section{Course Description}
\label{sec:orgf7cf0b5}
Chemistry AB is a laboratory-based college-preparatory course. Laboratory experiments provide the empirical basis for understanding and confirming concepts. This course emphasizes discussions, activities, and laboratory exercises, which promote the understanding of the behavior of matter at the macroscopic and the molecular-atomic levels. Chemical principles are introduced so that students will be able to explain the composition and chemical behavior of their world. Chemistry AB lays the foundation for further studies in Chemistry and also serves as an Advanced Placement Chemistry readiness course. 

\textbf{Chemistry AB meets the Grades 9-12 District physical science requirement. Students must complete one physical and one life science requirement. This course meets one year of the University of California 'd' entrance requirement for laboratory science.}
