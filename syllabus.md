# **The periodic table** displays the elements in increasing **atomic number** and shows how periodicity of the physical and chemical properties of the elements relates to atomic structure. 

- use the periodic table to identify metals, semimetals, nonmetals, and halogens. 
- use the periodic table to identify alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and transition metals, trends in ionization **energy**, electronegativity, and the relative sizes of ions and atoms. 
- use the periodic table to determine the number of electrons available for bonding. 
- use the periodic table to identify the lanthanide, actinide, and transactinide elements and know that the transuranium elements were synthesized and identified in laboratory experiments through the use of nuclear accelerators. 

- use the periodic table to identify:

- relate the position of an element in the periodic table to its ****atomic number**** and **atomic mass**. 
- relate the position of an element in the periodic table to its quantum electron configuration and to its reactivity with other elements in the table.

- the **nucleus** of the atom is much smaller than the atom yet contains most of its mass. 

 
# Biological, chemical, and physical properties of matter result from the ability of atoms to form bonds from electrostatic forces between electrons and **proton**s and between atoms and **molecule**s.

- salt crystals, such as NaCl, are repeating patterns of positive and negative ions held together by electrostatic attraction.
