COURSE SYLLABUS 

##  The periodic table displays the elements in increasing atomic number and shows how periodicity of the physical and chemical properties of the elements relates to atomic structure. As a basis for understanding this concept: 

- relate the position of an element in the periodic table to its **atomic number** and **atomic mass**. 
- use the periodic table to identify metals, semimetals, nonmetals, and halogens. 
- use the periodic table to identify alkali metals, alkaline earth metals and transition metals, trends in ionization energy, electronegativity, and the relative sizes of ions and atoms. 
- use the periodic table to determine the number of electrons available for bonding. 
- the nucleus of the atom is much smaller than the atom yet contains most of its mass. 
- use the periodic table to identify the lanthanide, actinide, and transactinide elements and know that the transuranium elements were synthesized and identified in laboratory experiments through the use of nuclear accelerators. 
- relate the position of an element in the periodic table to its quantum electron configuration and to its reactivity with other elements in the table. 
- the experimental basis for Thomson’s discovery of the electron, Rutherford’s nuclear atom, Millikan’s oil drop experiment, and Einstein’s explanation of the photoelectric effect. 
- the experimental basis for the development of the quantum theory of atomic structure and the historical importance of the Bohr model of the atom. 
- spectral lines are the result of transitions of electrons between energy levels and that these lines correspond to photons with a frequency related to the energy spacing between levels by using Planck’s relationship (E = hv). 

 
 ## Biological, chemical, and physical properties of matter result from the ability of atoms to form bonds from electrostatic forces between electrons and protons and between atoms and molecules. As a basis for understanding this concept:
