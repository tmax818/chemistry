I hope you're doing well. I wanted to reach out regarding some concerns about your child's behavior in chemistry class. Recently, there have been instances of disruptive behavior and unsafe actions that are impacting the learning environment. These actions include talking during lessons, running in class and/or throwing objects and intentionally making loud noises with the intent to disrupt instruction.

We take safety and the well-being of all students very seriously, and I would appreciate your support in addressing this matter. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to discuss this further. Together, we can help ensure that your child has a productive and safe experience in class.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.

Sincerely,
Tyler Maxwell
chemistry teacher
