Name: ____________________
Sweet Model of the Atom

Purpose
The purpose of this lab is to visually see how atoms, isotopes and ions are put together.

Materials
Do not eat any of your materials until you are instructed to do so.
M&M’s			Skittles		Nerds

Procedure

You need a piece of loose leaf paper to carry out the lab.
For the following examples, be sure to make them using your candies. When you have made the model with your candy, draw the atom on your paper.
Be sure to answer the questions as you complete the activity.

ATOMS
	Si	Ne

	e-	e-
	p+	p+
	no	no


Which of the two atoms above do you think is “happiest” (in scientific terms that means more stable)? Why?
(Hint: think about which element has a FULL shell – do you think this is a good situation for an atom?)






	ISOTOPES
The most common isotope of S is…	A less common isotope of S could be…

	e-	e-
	p+	p+
	no	no


Explain how you determined the most common isotope.



IONS
A positive ion (cation) is made by ______________________. A negative ion (anion) is made by _____________________.

Make the following atom and its most stable ion… 
		P							P___	(fill in the charge)

	e-	e-
	p+	p+
	no	no


		Al							Al___	(fill in the charge)

	e-	e-
	p+	p+
	no	no



How many electrons prefer to be in the outer most shell? 
	This is called the octet rule.

Analysis
For these ions, you do not have to make the atoms with your candies unless you get stumped. Answer the following questions:
Explain how each of the following ions are made from their neutral atom.
Mg2+	B-



S2+	N5-



From the ions in question 1, which is (as in ONLY ONE) the most stable? Why?



What are the two most stable ions magnesium can make?



From your answer to question 3, which ion does magnesium prefer to make? Explain.
